Identify Key Metrics for Low-Cost vs. Non-Low-Cost Airlines

Business Context:
Airline companies want to understand how low-cost carriers compare to traditional carriers in terms of profitability and efficiency.

Problem Statement:
Compare the average values of the following metrics between low-cost (low_cost_carrier = 'Y') and non-low-cost carriers:
EBIT in USD (ebit_usd)
Load Factor (load_factor)
Number of Routes (num_routes)
Passenger Yield (passenger_yield)
Average Fleet Age (avg_fleet_age)


Guiding Questions:
1. What is the average EBIT for low-cost vs. non-low-cost airlines?
2. Do low-cost carriers generally operate newer or older fleets?
3. How does the passenger yield compare between the two groups?
